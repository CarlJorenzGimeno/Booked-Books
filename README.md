# Booked Books
This is a web application designed for book club members and administrators to easily access, borrow, view, and track records of books based on availability, genre, and quantity. The website is managed by a book club at school and involves club administrators who are able to add/remove/update books from the database and students (end-users) who can check and view whether their desired book/s for borrowing/renting is available or not. If rented, the date and time will be recorded for tracking.

# Features

[In-Progress] User Authentication: The website requires users to login to access the database of books. Users can be classified as either club administrators or students. The login process is secure to protect the privacy and security of the users.

[In-Progress] User Roles: There are different user roles with different permissions. Club administrators have full access to add, remove, and update books from the database. Students have limited access to the database to check the availability of books.

[In-Progress] Book Management: Club administrators can add, remove, and update books in the database. They can add details such as book title, author, cover image, description, genre, and availability status.

[In-Progress] User Feedback (Optional): The website allows students to rate and review the books they have rented. This can help other students decide whether to rent a particular book or not.
